Armocromy is a website with the aim to help the audience with the color analysis to improve their own look style.

Armocromy technique was not well known in the past, but it is becoming really popular in the last years.This website was made for introducing people to this innovative method.

## Features 

The website consists of the following sections:
1. Home
2. Description
3. Test

### Existing Features

- __Navigation Bar__
* The nav bar is present in the three pages of the site. It is located under the logo and uses a soft color that immediately gives the idea of glamour and style. It includes links for Home, Description and Test and the same style has been chosen for each of them to give the idea of continuity to users.

* This section has been designed to give the possibility to move easily from page to page using all types of devices.This way users can easily go back to the previous page or skip to the next one, without clicking the back button.

- __Four seasons section__ 

* Four seasons logic is the core machine of Armocromy method.Users are first introduced to the concept that there are four main palettes in which the various prototypes are divided.

* Immediately after, the four seasons of Color Chroma are explained with their strengths: Undertone / Value / Intensity.

* The different color choice for all the seasons, is not casual. Those are some strong colors for each reference palette.

- __Watch the video section__ 

* The most representative musics for elegance and balance in this case are the violin concerts of Vivaldi, The Four Seasons.

* The harmony resulting from listening the video refers to the idea of harmony in the use of colors for the four palettes.

- __Test section__

* Test section is the last part to visit in the website. After a virtual journey into the land of colors, users are now intrigued and they want to know more about their color palette.

* They can fill a form providing some basic info as Name, Last Name and Email Address. They can also complete the form with the main characteristics of their prototype: skin tone, hair color and eye color.

* The aim of the test is to receive an initial analysis of their palette, to be further explored in the future.

## Typography and color scheme

* For the realization of this project I used two intriguing fonts and a color palette that recalled the world of glamor.

### Fonts

I have used two serif fonts:

1. Bodoni Moda
2. Playfair Display

### Colors

* For the colors of this project I have used mainly pink and fuchsia shades because they immediately evoke a glamorous environment inspired to personal care. 

* For the rest of the website I have used a full wheel of color to give the feeling that all the users can find their best fitting colors.
